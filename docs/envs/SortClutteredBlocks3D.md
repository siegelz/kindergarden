**Random Action Stats**: Total Reward: -0.25, Success: No, Steps: 25

## Description
A 3D task where the robot must sort a pile of objects into different receptacles based on their color. The objects may be initially in contact with each other, requiring singulation before grasping.

The robot has a holonomic mobile base with powered casters and a Kinova Gen3 arm.

The robot can control:
- Base pose (x, y, theta)
- Arm position (x, y, z)
- Arm orientation (quaternion)
- Gripper position (open/close)


## Available Variants
The variants differ in the number of objects to sort and in the types of receptacles (a cupboard or bins).

## Observation Space
*(Differs per variant, see individual variant pages)*

## Action Space
Actions: base pos and yaw (3), arm joints (7), gripper pos (1)

## Rewards
The primary reward is for successfully placing objects at their target locations.
- A reward of +1.0 is given for each object placed within a 5cm tolerance of its target.
- A smaller positive reward is given for objects within a 10cm tolerance to guide the robot.
- A small negative reward (-0.01) is applied at each timestep to encourage efficiency.
The episode terminates when all objects are placed at their respective targets.
